{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Looking before me, there are so many bits and bobs, I can't help but feel a little overwhelemd.","\n","^Lady Florana always told me that potions were quite advanced and it would be years before I got to learn how to make them...","\n","^Seemingly sensing my hesitation, Dust gives me a shaky smile and motions to the station.","\n","^\"I know it can seem a little overwhelming, but trust me, potions are really fun to make and experiment with. If you throw in different ingrendents in different mesaurements, you can always make something different!","\n","^I personally love making potions than most magic, though don't get me wrong, magic comes in handy in all kinds of ways... and I'm rambling a little now...\"","\n","^I smile now tugging on my own lips, I nod and then shake my head.","\n","^\"Not rambling, it's good to know my new Master of Magic has such a passion for the craft they have a job in.\"","\n","^That seems to make Dust relax too and now I can feel the atmosphere in the room is already more familiar and somewhat calming. I now feel like I can totally do this and kick some potion butt!","\n","^I look at the table and notice something.","\n","^There's no ingrendents...","\n","^\"O-Oh sorry,\" Dust puts them out on the table and gives another nervous laugh. \"My bad, I forgot to ask you to go to the garden before I show you about potion making...","\n","^Well, now that we have everything, this is what you need to do and for now, let's just focus on making potions to a recipe.\"","\n","^\"Sure thing!\"","\n","^\"Okay, this is a cure for Wheat Blindness for Tiddles Von Tarmac? D-Do you know what he does here?\"","\n","^I laugh. \"Yes, Tiddles works in the local bakery. I heard he once lied to a passing traveller about the kind of wheat he used in his bread,","\n","^and she was so angry at this lie that she hexed him to have blindness to all kinds of wheat when making his bread... Turns out more than 8 Bakers a year suffer from lack of Wheat Vision... truly sad.\"","\n","^Dust looks at me like I've told the biggest lie. \"That's not true. I've never made a Wheat Vision Potion of all things...\"","\n","^\"No it's true! It works, you will have to come see it when Tiddles takes the potion. The bread he makes when he is lacking in wheat vision... it's bad...\"","\n","^\"W-Well, I'll take your word for it since I'm new... have a go at brewing a Wheat Vision Potion.\"","\n","^Well, it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, but I was able to read the other instructions on the parchment and started brewing.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
