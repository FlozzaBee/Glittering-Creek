I am excited to be able to meet the new mage that is moving in.","\n","^I really hope they are kind and willing to help me acomplish my apprenticeship.","\n","^Nervously I approach them and try to strike up a conversation.","\n","^\"H-Hello! My name is Luna Birchwood. It's a pleasure to meet you. I-I've been here in Glimmering Creek since I was born and well, the last Mage, Lady Florana, was teaching me how to be a witch and I just wanted to say...","\n","^I am more than happy to continue my studies with you if you're willing!\"","\n","^Not leaving them much room to speak, I can see they are a little overwhlemed by my somewhat nervous energy. Their thin lips pull into a thin line and crossing their arms across their chest, they speak in a small voice.","\n","^\"Nice to meet you. Forgive me, but I didn't expect to meet anyone from the city so soon, espically someone who is a fellow Mage. You can call me Dust Lioncourt. But... just Dust is fine.\"","\n","^Dust seems kind, albeit nervous and not exactly in the mood to talk too much.","\n","^While there was still a lot to unpack from the van, this area is already looking rather full with the old workbench for potion making,","\n","^as well as the main desk where the townspeople can ask for particular potions to help with their many alements.","\n","^A beat of silence passes between us before I gasp and hit my head in faux stupidity.","\n","^\"Sorry, I forgot to ask, what are your pronouns? Mine are She/They. Expect to be asked this a lot while you're still new here, ahah.\"","\n","^Dust gives off a nervous hum.","\n","^\"I-I'm surpised people ask here... You can use They/Them, thank you.\"","\n","^Smiling I continue. \"Thanks for telling me, and yeah, everyone here in Glimmering Creek want to make sure everyone feels accepted and happy here.","\n","^We may have our dark days, but it's nice to know that people are at least respectful of my pronouns.\"","\n","^The room grows quiet again and I think Dust is going to simply turn and leave, but instead they motion towards the potion making station.","\n","^\"Would you like to have a go at making a potion? It would be nice to have a hand while I unpack, and well, if you want to continue your training, I guess you can try and start there.\"","\n","^A little flabberghasted, I take a moment to think things through.","\n","ev","str","^Yes","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n","^(Feeling my heart sing at the ability to be able to actually work on my studies, I jump forward with excitement and I'm sure Dust can see my eyes practically sparkle.)","\n","^\"Yes! I would be more than happy to help! I can assure you, while I haven't covered potions much- I was mostly doing small healing magic and plant magic- I totally can do this! I read books!\"","\n","^A slight chuckle bubbles out of Dust and puts me at ease.","\n","ev",{"f()":"act"},"pop","/ev","\n","^\"Alright, let's get to it.\"","\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"act":["ev",true,"/ev",{"VAR=":"action","re":true},{"#f":1}],"global decl":["ev",false,{"VAR=":"action"},"/ev","end",null],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
