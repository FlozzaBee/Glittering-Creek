Pet the cat?
* [yes]
Awww, this is Mittens, she always loves to greet me on my way around Glimmering Creek. She doesn't seem to have a permanent home,
but nontheless, she is beloved by the community and there's always someone happy to feed her.
* [no]
this game is all about warm and fuzzy feelings. You should probably pet the cat.
