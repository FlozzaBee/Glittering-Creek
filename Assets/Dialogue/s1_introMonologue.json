This town embued with magic and modern science is something that always facinated me when I grew up here as a child.","\n","^I always had a dream to become the next mage in the town, to be able too look after everyone and keep the village in order through my ability to use magic to solve any issues that could arise.","\n","^But since Lady Florana left to go to the capital for retirement, I haven't been able to continue my studies.","\n","^It's been three months, but we finally have someone new who was intersted in taking her place. I don't know much about them, but according to the mayor, they seemed eager to move in as soon as possible.","\n","^I'm excited. I want to become thier new apprentice and continue my training to be (hopefully) the best mage in Glimmering Creek!","\n","^I look at the clock and see I'm already running late. The moving truck was due to arrive half an hour ago!","\n","^I scramble to put my clothes on and run out the door.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
